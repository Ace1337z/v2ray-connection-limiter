v2ray-connection-limiter
with this script you can detect and ban the V2ray accounts which aren't only connected to one devices

It's simple part i could do for the ppl who providing VPN for iranian users so they could selling VPN for more and more users. so 50 50 WIN WIN ! VPN providers getting money to get more Servers and many users Could get VPN as well lol. we should be togheder right ?

so i made something for VLESS and other protocols (vmess seems blocked in iran) which you can detect those accounts which using by more than 1 IP ! this script might has some bugs and it's possible to get more power from CPU SERVER .! so check everything first and put it on background

you can change Limits in line 8 >> _max_allowed_connections = 1 (1 means only one device could able to connect but i suggest to set it on 3 it works great then, becuase sometimes switching between mobileData and ADSL gonna make some issues so num 3 is better .)

note : at this time script doesn't update new users right now . i gonna make it happen.

tested on this V2ray: https://seakfind.github.io/2021/10/10/X-UI/
